The classic coding learning projects

Hello Humans!

This is a space where I will upload bits and pieces of code from my educational journey to become a proficient programer. This is really something im doing for myself as a way to track my coding educational journey and I also believe that it will encourage and inspire me to write more code, I dont expect anyone to really look at this.
